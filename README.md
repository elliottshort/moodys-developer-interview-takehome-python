### Who We're Looking For

You've got skills. You're motivated. You've got a passion for excellence. All you've been missing is a place to put it all together. Moody's Analytics could be that place.

The Moody's Analytics engineering team is looking for a forward-thinking software engineer who will work on a variety of projects, used by many thousands of people. You will be at the very center of transforming our organization and working to fundementally shift the way we do business. Your domain of expertise will reach from back-end to brain-melting integrations, to web, to the next technology that becomes the new best way to help the finance industry succeed. Technology moves quickly and so do we, so the ideal candidate is creative and ready to help forge new paths as part of a team focused on serving the needs of some of the largest organizations in the world with excellent, modern software.

If you have a full-stack mentality, the willingness to jump in and execute on any problem thrown at you, and have a tendency of running to; instead of away from trouble, read on to see if you might be the perfect fit for this role!

#### Who you are:

-   Great at solving large, complicated, and brain-melting technology problems
-   Comfortable dealing with ambiguity, flexible deadlines, and constantly doing new things
-   A strong time manager with the organizational skills to drive projects to completion
-   Consistently seeking to learn and grow personally and professionally

#### What you'll do:

-   Join a fast-moving team passionate about innovating and creating the best software we can for an extremely dynamic, fast moving industry
-   Be part of a team who cares about you and your personal growth and development
-   Design, build, and own various services and web frontends — from their conception to production and maintenance
-   Create simple, clean, testable code to power new product features, as well as refactor and improve existing code when things get a little too hairy
-   Take ownership of projects and oversee them with minimal direction

## Objective
Your mission is to use a variety of technologies in order to build a simple web application that emulates some of the *very basic* functionality of **Instagram™**.

##### Expected Functionality
- Upload a photo with a provided description.
- Scroll through a "Timeline" of uploaded photos that are *LIFO* (latest uploads appearing first).
- Search for photos that have been previously uploaded, *based on the description text at a minimum*.

##### Additional Expectations
- The client application should be deployed somewhere (Heroku, VPS, AWS, Azure, etc) that we can access. You should provide a link to the working front end you've developed as part of your submission; as a portion of the evaluation will be using the web based client and ensuring that it functions appropriately.
- You should provide a link to the publicly available repository whenever you send the submission email. We will also evaluate the provided codebase as part of your submission.
- This assignment should be completed **no more than 72 hours after receiving it**.

##### Bonus Points
- There's a concept of user accounts.
- I can "like" a photo.
- The user experience is polished and intuitive.
- Tests are included.
- You use some sort of file store (ex. S3) in order to store the photos instead of coverting them to Base64 for storage in Elasticsearch.

#### Technologies We Expect You To Incorporate

##### Client Side
- [Jinja templating engine](https://jinja.palletsprojects.com/en/3.0.x/)

##### Server Side
- [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/)
- [RabbitMQ](https://www.rabbitmq.com/)
- [Elasticsearch](https://www.elastic.co/)

### Submission

Please organize, design, test and document your code as if it were going into production, then push your changes to the master branch.

After you have pushed your code, you may submit the assignment by replying to the email you've received with:

- The link to the deployed and working web front end of the application.
- The link to the repository's master branch on Github, GitLab, etc.
